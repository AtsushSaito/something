# LeanDojo Testing Summary

## Repository

We've created and pushed a Lean 4 project to:
https://github.com/AtsushSaito/something.git

## Project Structure

The repository contains:

- A basic Lean 4 project with Lean 4.3.0 toolchain
- Simple theorems in `Something/Basic.lean` to test with LeanDojo
- A test script `test_leandojo.py` to interact with the repository

## Testing Results

We were able to verify that LeanDojo version 4.19.0 is installed and working correctly through the `simple_test.py` script in the parent directory, which confirmed:

- All required LeanDojo modules are accessible
- Basic features such as `LeanFile`, `Pos`, `Dojo`, `trace`, and `LeanGitRepo` are working

However, we encountered challenges with the full LeanDojo workflow:

1. The `trace` function in LeanDojo had issues with our repository structure, producing errors when running `ExtractData.lean`
2. This prevented us from getting theorems from the repository and interacting with them through the Dojo interface

These issues may be related to compatibility between LeanDojo 4.19.0 and Lean 4.3.0, or could be related to our repository structure.

## Next Steps

To fully test LeanDojo with the repository, you may want to:

1. Check compatibility between LeanDojo and Lean versions
2. Ensure the repository structure follows the expected format for LeanDojo
3. Try with a simpler example or use one of the examples provided with LeanDojo

## Conclusion

While we were able to create a Lean project repository and verify that LeanDojo is installed correctly, further work is needed to get the full LeanDojo workflow working with our custom repository.
